### Data Description

The Mortgage Default Risk Index (MDRI) captures household mortgage
default risk by aggregating internet search queries such as
"foreclosure help" and "mortgage help". Chauvet, Gabriel, and Lutz
(2016) find that the MDRI is a leading indicator of traditional
measures of mortgage default risk.
